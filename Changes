Changes for App-ArchiveDevelCover

1.001   2012-04-04T07:20:04-0400
    - added diff.html that shows which coverage metrics
      have changed per file
      NOTE: archives generated with older version probably won't
            display correct, as I've added a new column to the
            HTML table. You will need to add the column by hand to
            index.html


1.000   2012-02-20T21:48:21+0100
    - first release based on a small script I wrote a few days ago
